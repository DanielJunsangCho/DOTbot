## =' Technical Implementation

### Dependency Injection Pattern

All services use FastAPI's dependency injection system:

```python
@router.post("/scrape")
async def scrape_url(
    request: ScrapeRequest,
    scraping_service: ScrapingService = Depends(get_scraping_service)
):
    return await scraping_service.execute_scrape(request)
```

### Pydantic v2 Validation

Comprehensive validation with custom validators:

```python
class ScrapeRequest(BaseModel):
    model_config = ConfigDict(validate_assignment=True)
    
    @validator('url')
    @classmethod
    def validate_url(cls, v: str) -> str:
        if not v.startswith(('http://', 'https://')):
            raise ValueError('URL must start with http:// or https://')
        return v
```

### LangGraph Node Contracts

Explicit contracts as required by CLAUDE.md:

```python
class ScrapingNode(BaseLangGraphNode):
    inputs = {"url": str, "scrape_mode": str, "max_depth": int}
    outputs = {"raw_scrapes": List[RawScrapeData], "success": bool}
    
    async def process(self, state: UnifiedState) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Implementation with contract validation
```

### Error Handling Strategy

Multi-layer error handling:
- **Router Level**: HTTP error codes and user-friendly messages
- **Service Level**: Business logic validation and recovery
- **Node Level**: State preservation and workflow continuation
- **Component Level**: Resource cleanup and logging

        # Step 1: Fast link discovery with Playwright (no API costs)
        if depth == 0:
            result = await self._scrape_and_extract_links_playwright(url)
            # Successfully finds 25+ article links in seconds
        
        # Step 2: AI-powered content extraction for individual articles
